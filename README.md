# hello-world
it's just the begining. Believe it !!!
I'm new to that. I have to make a long long nerdy way to get my nerd eyes on max skills !!
I'll become a great coder then, a developer. Web development will be my first attempt.
I already do some HTML CSS and now I'll work on javascript, then PHP + MySQL to master everything I got to !
